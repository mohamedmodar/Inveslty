# Inveslty: Asset Price Prediction Platform for Alexandria

## Overview

Inveslty is a data-driven platform designed to predict asset prices, including gold, currency, and real estate, in Alexandria. Leveraging advanced machine learning and data science techniques, Inveslty empowers users with actionable insights to make informed decisions. This platform aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and confidence in asset valuation within the Alexandria community.

## Objectives of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust, data-driven system that predicts asset prices, including gold, currency, and real estate, in Alexandria. This system will leverage advanced machine learning and data science techniques to empower users with actionable insights. To achieve this, the following objectives are outlined:

**Data Collection and Analysis**

* Gather and preprocess real-world market data from reliable sources, including financial platforms, real estate agencies, and public economic reports.
* Identify and analyze key factors influencing asset prices, such as location, size, market trends, economic conditions, and historical price patterns.

**Model Development**

* Develop and train machine learning models capable of predicting asset prices (e.g., house prices or gold values) with high accuracy.
* Continuously evaluate and fine-tune model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others.

**Authentication and User Experience**

* Implement secure sign-up and login functionality to protect user data and enhance personalization.
* Create a seamless, user-friendly interface that allows users to input relevant details (e.g., property or asset attributes) and obtain accurate predictions.

**Software and Website Development**

* Build an intuitive web-based platform for users to access predictions and insights.

**Market Insights and Visualization**

* Provide users with additional insights, such as market trends, price distribution, and neighborhood or regional comparisons.
* Implement dynamic and interactive data visualizations (e.g., charts and graphs) for clearer decision-making.

**Community Impact**

* Design a tool that caters to multiple stakeholders, including sellers, investors, and general users, by offering accurate and transparent market data.
* Empower users to make well-informed decisions, reducing reliance on subjective opinions or manual analysis.

**Scalability and Future Growth**

* Build a scalable system capable of handling large datasets, future updates, and retraining of machine learning models.
* Ensure the platform is secure, reliable, and adaptable to accommodate growing user demand and additional features.

By accomplishing these objectives, the project aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and confidence in asset valuation for the Alexandria community while demonstrating the power of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges.

## Key Features

* **Interactive User Interface:** A dynamic and engaging interface allows users to interact with the platform in real-time.
* **Secure Authentication:** Robust sign-up and login functionality protects user data and provides a personalized experience.
* **Asset Price Prediction:** Machine learning models provide accurate predictions for asset prices, including gold, currency, and real estate.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Users can access valuable market insights, trends, and visualizations to support their decision-making.
* **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling provides informative feedback to the user.
* **Scalable Architecture:** The system is designed to handle large datasets and future growth.

## Technologies Used

* Frontend:  (Add specific frontend technologies here, e.g., React, Vue.js, etc.)
* Backend:   (Add specific backend technologies here, e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, etc.)
* Database:  (Add database technology here, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* Machine Learning: (Add ML libraries here, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js and npm:  (Link to Node.js installation guide)
* (Add any other prerequisites, e.g., Python, a specific database, etc.)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mohamedmodar/Inveslty.git](https://github.com/mohamedmodar/Inveslty.git)
    cd Inveslty
    ```
2.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend  # Navigate to the backend folder
    npm install
    ```
3.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend  # Navigate to the frontend folder
    npm install
    ```
4.  Configure the environment:
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    * Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys, etc.).  See the `.env.example` file for a template.

### Running the Application

1.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run start
    ```
    This will typically start the server at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port, as defined in your `.env` file).

2.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually start the frontend server at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).  The application should automatically open in your browser.
